#Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the results of four basic arithmetic operations. The results have to be printed to the console.

# Layout:
# input a float value for variable a here
# input a float value for variable b here

# output the result of addition here
# output the result of subtraction here
# output the result of multiplication here
# output the result of division here

#print("\nThat's all, folks!")


a = float(input("Enter a value for a: "))
b = float(input("Enter a value for b: "))

print("a + b = ", a+b)
print("a - b = ", a-b)
print("a * b = ", a*b)
print("a / b = ", round(a/b,2))

print("\nThat's all, folks!")
